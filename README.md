# 🤖 AI-Powered Monitoring & Detection Web Application

## 🧠 Overview
An end-to-end **web application** that integrates **computer vision and machine learning** to detect predefined behaviors in monitored environments.
The system includes model training/evaluation, a real-time inference pipeline, and a web-based interface backed by API services for scalable deployment.

---

## 🎯 Key Features
- 🌐 Web application interface for interacting with the system
- 👁️ Computer vision–based detection and classification
- 🤖 Multiple AI models integrated within a unified workflow
- ⚡ Real-time inference pipeline
- 🔌 API-based model access (Flask / FastAPI)
- 🛡️ Security-aware system design considerations

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The solution is composed of three main layers:

1. **Web Application Layer**
   - UI for uploads / requests / viewing outputs 
   - Connects to inference endpoints

2. **AI Services Layer**
   - Data preprocessing
   - Model inference (real-time predictions)
   - Optional: training & evaluation modules

3. **API / Backend Layer**
   - REST endpoints exposing AI inference
   - Decoupled services for scalability and maintainability
